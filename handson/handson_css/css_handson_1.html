        <li class="pad">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li class="pad">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li class="pad"><del><b>Css is not nrccesary</b></del><b class="yb">CSS saves a lot of work.</b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li class="pad"><i><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</u></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2><i>CSS can be added to html document in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external CSS files. However, <b class="yb">in this tutorials we will use inline and internal CSS styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand applies a style to a unique element. ID is also special in that in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element on a web page. once an element has been targeted, a style or a set of styles can be applied to the element</p>
    <p>There is wide range of selectors available, Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>

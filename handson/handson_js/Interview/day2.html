    <h1>Day2 interview questions</h1>
    <p><b>1. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</b></p>
    <p> These are the different ways of invoking a function <br>
        It assumes that the first argument is object that can be passed to
        the function. <br>
        call: In case of call each and every argument which is required to passed to the 
        function will be passed individually. <br>
        apply: In case of apply each and every argument which is required to be passed to the function
        will be passed inside an array <br>
        bind: In case of bind, a new function is created. this new function can be used anytime
        anywhere.

    </p>
    <pre>
        let obj = {
            name: 'my_name',
            age: 25
        }
        function fun(a,b){
            console.log(this.name+this.age+a+b);
        }
        const a='satish';
        const b=44;
        fun.call(obj,a,b);// apply arguments individually
        fun.apply(obj,[a,b]);// aplly arguments in array;
        const new_fun = fun.bind(obj);
        obj.new_fun(a,b);// creates a new function for 'this' reference
    </pre>

    <p><b>2. What are objects in javascript?</b></p>
    <p>Objects are non premitive datatypes and are used to store multiple data in 
       key value pairs. 
    </p>
    <pre>
        const onjname = {
            propery_name : property_value,
            method_name : ()=>{ console.log(this.property_name) }
        }
    </pre>
    <p><b>3. What are function constructors?</b></p>
    <p>Function constructor is a kind of regular function to create multiple objects at a time.
       When creating function constructor, it is good practice to keep the first 
       letter of the name, capital. <br>
       new and this keyword is mandatory to be used with function constructor.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function Person(name, salary){
            this.name = name,
            this.salary = salary
        }

        const person1 = new Person('name', 1000);
    </pre>
    <p><b>4. Explain prototypes </b></p>
    <p>
        every object in javascript inherits its properties and methods from 
        its prototype. If you want to add any property or method to a function 
        constructor, you can add them to its prototype. 
    </p>

    <pre>
        Person.prototype.newProp = 'new property';
    </pre>
    <p><b>5. What is prototype chain</b></p>
    <p>
        One object can inherit properties from another object. every object 
        inherits properties of its prototype. prototypes are also objects
        containing their own methods and properties. they also have another 
        prototype object. this chain goes on and end at null object which 
        contains no properties and methods. this is called prototype chain.
    </p>
    <p><b>6. Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</b></p>
    <pre>
        function obj(a,b,c){
            this.one =a;
            this.two =b;
            this.three = c;
        }
        console.log(obj.prototype)
    </pre>
    <p><b>7. What are callbacks?</b></p>
    <p> 
        Call back function are the functions which are passed as an argument
        to an another function.
    </p>
    <pre>
        function my_fun(a, callBack){
            console.log(a);
            callBack();
        }
    </pre>
    <p> Why do we use it : The call vacks are needed because javascript is an 
        event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response 
        javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    </p>
    <p><b>8. What is the use of setTimeout</b></p>
    <p>setTimeout method is used to invoke or execute a task after certain time
        or specified number of milliseconds.
    </p>
    <pre>
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log('task inside setTimeout')
        },2000) // will be executed after 2 seconds
    </pre>
    <p><b>9. What are pure functions?</b></p>
    <p>Pure function is a function which always gives same output with same
        given input. which means it does not depend on any variables which are 
        out of its scope
    </p>
    <pre>
        function fun(a,b,c){
            console.log(a*b+c);
            return a-b*c;
        }
    </pre>

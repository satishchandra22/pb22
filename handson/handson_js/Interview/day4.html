    <h1>Day 4 inetrview questions</h1>
    <p><b>1. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</b></p>
    <p>Temporal dead zone is a block where let and const variables are stored
        until they get intialized with a value. We can not access the variables
        in temporal dead zone. if we try to access them , we get reference error.
        one way to solve this problem is to move let and const declarations to 
        the top of the block.
    </p>
    <p><b>2. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</b></p>
    <p>for-in loop is a special for loop which iterates through indexes or 
        keys of the object passed to it.
    </p>
    <pre>
        for (const i in object){
            //code
        }
    </pre>
    <p><b>3. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</b></p>
    <p>Local scope and functional scope are similar. all the varables declared inside a function 
        and function parameters will have local scope, which meanse they can be accessed only inside the function.
        variables declared inside a block can only be accessed inside that block which is called block scope.
        When a variable is used in JavaScript, the JavaScript engine will try to find the variable's
        value in the current scope. If it could not find the variable, it will look into the outer scope 
        and will continue to do so until it finds the variable or reaches global scope. this is called 
        scope chain.
    </p>
    <p><b>4. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</b></p>
    <p>undefined is a datatype which is assigned to the variables which are not initialized. undefined 
        was assigned to all varibles in creation phase by interpreter. null is an user given value for 
        a variable. null is also a datatype and we get true if we compare undefined to null with double
        equal and false with triple equal.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. what is Symbol?</b></p>
    <p>Symbol is a primitive datatype in javascript. each time you use a sysmbol, we get an unique value
        assigned to the variable. 
    </p>
    <p><b>6. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</b></p>
    <p> map and filter are short hand notations of for loop.</p>
    <pre>
        const a = [1 , 2, 3];
        const b = a.map(x=> x*2);
        console.log(b)// [2,4,6];
    </pre>
    <pre>
        const c = a.filter(x=> x>1);
        console.log(c);// [2,3]
    </pre>
    <p><b>7. Explain passed by value and passed by reference</b></p>
    <p> when ever we assign primitive datatypes to a new variable, it always creates a new copy of the value.
        All the primitive datatypes are passed by the value. on otherhand, nonprimitive datatypes or objects
        are passed by reference. whenevr you assign an object to a new variable, reference to that object 
        is stored in that varible. 
    </p>
    <p><b>8. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</b></p>
    <p>IIFE or immediatly invoked function expression are thr special functions which are invoked
       only once without calling it. 
    </p>
    <pre>
        (function () {
            //code
        })();
    </pre>
    <p><b>9. What is an event loop and call stack</b></p>
    <p>Whenever we run an asychronous task in javascript, the task goes to web api's for serving its time.
       after serving its time, task goes to witing queue. event loop keep's track of exrcution context
       in call stack and push tasks in the waiting queue into call stack to get executed synchronously.
    </p>

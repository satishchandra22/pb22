    <h1>Day3 Interview questions</h1>
    <p><b>1. What are promises and why do we need them?</b></p>
    <p> Promise objects are used to manage asynchronus operations. They are used to resolve api calls 
        and also for call back hell. They contain three stages which are pending, resolved and rejected.
        We can initialize a promise with resolve and reject statements and call them using .then() and 
        .catch() methods. 
    </p>
    <p><b>2. What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</b></p>
    <p>async/await key words are used for asynchronous operations. They are introdused in es8 vertion. 
       they make promises esier to write. async used before a function. function with async keyword 
       always returns a promise. await makes a function wait for the promise.
    </p>
    <p><b>3. What is hoisting?</b></p>
    <p>var and regular function declarations are atomatically moved to the top of code while executing.
       this is called hoisting. const andn let declarartions does not support hoisting. 
    </p>
    <p><b>4. What is the DOM?</b></p>
    <p>DOM - short hand of Document Object Model. javascript treats HTML document as a logical tree  
       structure and each node in the tree represents a html element. 
    </p>
    <p><b>5. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</b></p>
    <p>undefined and not defined are data types where NaN is a property.
       when ever we declare a variable, undefined is assigned to it until it get initialized. 
       not defined is thrown by interpret when we try to access undeclared varible. 
       NaN is thrown when you try to operate number methods on strings. it is a property to check
       wether the given datatype is a number or not. 
    </p>
    <p><b>6. How many operators do we have in JS ?</b></p>
    <p> we mainly have 6 operators
        <ul>
            <li>arthematic operators</li>
            <li>aiignment operator</li>
            <li>comparision operators</li>
            <li>logical operators</li>
            <li>Bitwise operator</li>
            <li>ternary operator</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><b>7. What is callback hell</b></p>
    <p>call back hell is a nested asynchrous operations which depends on execution of other 
       asynchronous opeartion. nested callback functions make programmer difficult to understand.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let production = () =>{console.log("Numbers");
        setTimeout(()=>{console.log("1")//prints after 1 sec
            setTimeout(()=>{console.log("2")//prints after 2 secs
                setTimeout(()=>{console.log("3")//prints after 3 secs
                    setTimeout(()=>{console.log("4")//prints after 4 secs
                        setTimeout(()=>{console.log("5")//prints after 5 secs
                            setTimeout(()=>{console.log("6")//prints after 6 secs
                                setTimeout(()=>{console.log("7")//prints after 7 secs
                                },7000)//sets timeout interval as 7 secs
                                },6000)//sets timeout interval as 6 secs
                            },5000)//sets timeout interval as 5 secs
                        },4000)//sets timeout interval as 4 secs
                    },3000)//sets timeout interval as 3 secs
                },2000)//sets timeout interval as 2 secs
            },1000)//sets timeout interval as 1 sec
        };
        production()
    </pre>
    <p><b>8. What is promise chaining</b></p>
    <p> promise chaining is producing series of promises to resolve call back hell. we will be writing 
        a function that returns a promise and will call that function where ever we need that promise.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let printNumber = ( time, num ) => {
            return new Promise( ( resolve, reject )=>{
                if( num ){setTimeout(()=>{resolve( num() )}, time)}
                else{reject( console.log("No number") )}
            })
        }
        printNumber( 0, ()=>console.log("Numbers"))//prints Numbers at 0thsec.
        .then(()=>{return printNumber(1000,()=>console.log('1'))//prints 1after 1 secs
          }).then(()=>{return printNumber(2000,()=>console.log('2'))//prints 2after 2 secs and so for others
              }).then(()=>{return printNumber(3000,()=>console.log('3'))
                  }).then(()=>{return printNumber(4000,()=>console.log('4'))
                      }).then(()=>{return printNumber(5000,()=>console.log('5'))
                           }).then(()=>{return printNumber(6000,()=>console.log('6'))
                               }).then(()=>{return printNumber(7000,()=>console.log('7'))})
    </pre>
    <p>
        <b>9. What are arrow functions?</b>
    </p>
    <p>arrow functions are short hand syntax for functional expressions. they assigned to variables.
       they can also be used as anonymous functions.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const a = ()=>{
            // code
        }
        a()
    </pre>
    <p><b>10. Give an example of async/await</b></p>
    <pre>
        async function tryingPromises(){
            console.log("I am inside the function using async/await");
            const response = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users");
            console.log("before the response is fetched");
            const users = await response.json();
            console.log("Users resolved");
            return users;
        }
        console.log("Before calling the function");
        let data = tryingPromises();
        console.log("After calling the function");
        console.log("data received",data);
        data.then((res)=>{console.log(res);})
        data.catch((err)=>{ console.log(err); })
    </pre>

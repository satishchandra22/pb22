    <h1>Day 1 Interview questions - React</h1>
    <p><b>1. What is Virtual DOM</b></p>
    <p>React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.</p>
    <p><b>2. What is SPA</b></p>
    <p>Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that does not use the default method of loading new pages completely. Instead, it takes new data from the webserver by interacting with the web browser and refreshes the current web page. HTML5 and AJAX are used to build responsive apps, and for handling the heavy traffic on the client-side, JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, etc are used. SPA provides a huge range of interactions such as interactions and smooth effects, which provide a great user experience. From using less bandwidth to quick loading time, SPAs have become a game-changer in today's market.</p>
    <p><b>3. What is difference between class and functional component</b></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Functional Component- Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function.</li>
        <li>Class component-  These components are simple classes (made up of multiple functions that add functionality to the application).</li>
       </ul>
       Hooks are a new addition to React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
       functional componenets does not use life cycle methods whereas they have hooks which provide lifecycle functionality for functional components.
    </p>
    <p><b>4. What do you mean by state and its use in react?</b></p>
    <p>React components has a built-in state object.

        The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
        
        When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
        we specify state object in a constructor in class component. In functional componenet, we use useState hook for managing the state of the component.
    </p>
    <p><b>5. What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?</b></p>
    <p>JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.

        JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
        
        You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.
    </p>
    <p><b>6. What is package.json</b></p>
    <p>The package.json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.</p>
